# bicycle-bell-sed-pipeline

**Author: Clemens Kubach**


## Description
This repository contains the ML-pipeline for inspecting and preparing the datasets, training the neural networks and evaluating them on hold-out data for my bachelor thesis about atomatically detecting the sound event of cyclists using their bicycle bell.

Written in Python 3.9.


## Usage
The jupyter notebook can be inspected without running on any system. 
For executing the cells, follow the instructions given in the notebook.

In the most cases, it is not necessary and **not recommended** to simply run **all cells**, because they are generating a lot of data and traffic.
This is already done and the prepared files can be found in the Google Cloud Storage bucket or the backup zip file of the bucket.

I.e., the trained models can also be found in GCS and can be loaded directly within the evaluation chapter.
